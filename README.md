# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Customer_Feedback

**Business Overview/Problem Summary**

Omega E-commerce Solutions, a leading player in the e-commerce industry, is focused on enhancing customer satisfaction and improving its products and services. To achieve this, the company needs to address several challenges related to processing and analyzing customer feedback effectively:

**1.	**Feedback Overload Management****

The large volume of daily customer reviews requires a more efficient system for handling and organizing feedback.

**2.	**Enhancing Sentiment Analysis****

Increasing the precision of sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral) is vital for extracting actionable insights from customer feedback.

**3.	Optimizing Resource Allocation**

Manual feedback analysis is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Automating these tasks is necessary to maximize efficiency and better allocate resources.

**Rationale for the Project**

Sentiment analysis, a key tool in natural language processing and data analytics, identifies the emotional tone of text (positive, negative, or neutral). It plays a vital role in understanding customer perceptions and influencing business decisions.
Businesses benefit from sentiment analysis by quickly addressing customer concerns, improving satisfaction, identifying areas for improvement, and staying competitive. It helps manage brand reputation, gain insights into competitors, enhance products, and improve operational efficiency through automation.

**Aim of the Project**

The project focuses on two primary objectives:

**1.	Sentiment Analysis Model Development**

Develop an NLP-based sentiment analysis model to classify customer feedback into positive and negative categories effectively.

**2.	Tool Implementation and Comparison**

Implement and compare the performance of sentiment analysis tools like NLTK and VADER.

Additionally, the project aims to provide:

•	Real-time sentiment analysis results to relevant teams for prompt decision-making.
•	Actionable insights from sentiment data to improve customer service and product quality.

The ultimate goal is to proactively address customer feedback and concerns, enhancing the overall customer experience.

**Data Description**

Omega E-commerce Solutions has compiled a dataset of 4 million customer reviews, which consists of:

**1.	Customer Comments/Reviews**

Textual feedback from customers, serving as input data for analysis.

**2.	Sentiment Labels**

Predefined sentiment classifications:

o	Positive (Label 2)

o	Negative (Label 1)

The dataset will be used to train a sentiment analysis model by utilizing customer reviews as input data and sentiment labels as the target variable.
